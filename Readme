The K28 is a simple flow controller for use with Emriver models and our GRI pump.
The newest version, 2, passes through 12/24V to the pump, sends a 5V (full speed) control voltage signal, and pulses GND using a MOSFET to finely control pump speed.
The contained file uses AVRdude to upload the Arduino code and set the low fuse bits of the microcontroller, telling it to use the internal oscillator for timing.
